# Scala Optimization Problem Solver

## Overview

This repository contains a simple Scala implementation of an optimization problem solver. The example provided demonstrates solving a quadratic function using gradient descent. The code is intended to run in a JupyterLab environment with a Scala kernel.

## Features

- **Quadratic Function Optimization:** Minimizes a quadratic function of the form `f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c`.
- **Gradient Descent Algorithm:** Implements a basic gradient descent method to find the minimum of the function.

## Getting Started

To use this project, you'll need to set up JupyterLab with the Scala kernel. Follow these steps to get started:

### Prerequisites

1. **Install JupyterLab:** Ensure you have JupyterLab installed. You can follow the [official installation guide](https://jupyter.org/install) if needed.

2. **Install Scala Kernel:** Install the Almond Scala kernel for JupyterLab. Run the following command:
   
   ```sh
   cs launch almond --install
   ```
### Setting Up the Project
#### Clone the Repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/scala-optimization-solver.git
   cd scala-optimization-solver
   ```
#### Create a New Jupyter Notebook:

Open JupyterLab and create a new notebook. Select the Scala kernel.

#### Add the Code to the Notebook:

Copy the provided Scala code into separate cells in the Jupyter notebook:

- Cell 1: Define the quadratic function and its derivative.
- Cell 2: Implement the gradient descent algorithm.
- Cell 3: Run the optimization and display the result.
